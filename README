This project is used to caputre a simple NITE and OpenNI project based on the sample code provided but built with a code::blocks project and not using makefiles. The intention is not to add or update the code but just to creat ea shell from which new projects can be built.

It was tested using NITE 1.3.0.17 and OpenNI stable installed in the default places according to the provided scripts. It was built on 32 bit Ubuntu 10.10

I have put the SampleConfig.xml file in a local directory but the path to this can be changed.

Also look at the build options for the whole project and look at the libraries and ssearch directories to see where it is pulling OpenNI and NITE libs.
